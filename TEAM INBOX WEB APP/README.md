# Team Inbox Web App

## Project Overview
Team Inbox is a modern, web-based email management application designed to streamline team communication and collaboration. It provides a centralized inbox where team members can view, manage, and respond to emails efficiently. The app features a rich text editor for composing emails, advanced search and filtering capabilities, and supports dark mode for comfortable usage in low-light environments.

Built with standard web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Team Inbox offers a responsive and intuitive user interface that enhances productivity and simplifies email handling for teams of any size.


## Setup Instructions
To get started with the Team Inbox Web App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.

2. **Open the project folder** in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).

3. **Open `index.html` or `app.html`** in a modern web browser to launch the application. No additional server setup is required as this is a client-side web app.

4. (Optional) If you want to make changes or extend the app:
   - Modify the JavaScript files such as `app.js`, `login.js`, and `searchFilter.js`.
   - Update styles in CSS files like `appstyle.css`, `darkmode.css`, and `loginpage-styles.css`.
   - The rich text editor functionality is powered by the included `richtexteditor` folder.

5. **To test email data**, the app uses a local JSON file `emails.json` as a mock data source.
